note : execute all commands from ws level directory

1. Pull from git to get sim

2. rosdep update --include-eol-distros

3. sudo apt-get update

4. rosdep install --from-path src -yi

5. build


debug notes:
1. Can only import sensor plugins once throughout the entire urdf, might apply to other plugins as well
2. oakd bringup launch file works, but if you force ignition version 5, the output is all black, which matches
    the behavior in the total sim launch file (which is where we also force version 5)
